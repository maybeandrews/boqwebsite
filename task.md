# update:

In the boq upload page right now we can choose a file and a description.
I want to be able to also upload a table containing sl. no, work detail and amount.
the client then on his dashboard should also be able to input values for the amount.
how would you go about doing this?
suggest measures and wait for my input before proceeding

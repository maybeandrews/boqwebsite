# Feature:

consider this: I have a couple of projects all realated to orchid gwalior,
each of them has a separate project for plumbing, hvac etc.. I want to be able to group them together. What would you suggest creating a sidebar in the dashboard for the specific project group? Or creating folders.

After I confirm the decision implement it
